# ⚡ Supabricx

Supabricx is a **full-stack accelerator** designed to make building apps as simple as running one command.  
Today it scaffolds **production-ready backends** (Express, NestJS, SpringBoot), and in the near future it will expand into:

- 🎨 **Frontend Components** — ready-to-use React, Vue, and Svelte UI blocks.  
- 🛠️ **Backend Blueprints** — scalable APIs, auth, and database integrations.  
- 🤖 **AI Web Builder** — generate full-stack apps instantly with natural language (think V0, Lovable, Orchids, Floot).  

Supabricx is built with the future in mind: a single toolchain for developers who want to move fast without being locked into one stack.
